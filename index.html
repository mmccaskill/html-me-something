                    <p>
                        "I was born in Sediala, MO, the home of the Missouri 
                        state fair. I only have a few memories of the place as 
                        I move slightly prior to my fourth birthday.  My Dad 
                        traveled with his job and we had to move a few times when
                        I was little.  Of the memories I have, one is going to the 
                        fair and getting cotton candy, another is going to the park 
                        climbing on a historic locomotive and the other is playing 
                        with the neighbors black dog."

                        Following my Dad on the the golf course. Seeing movies with my sister
                        at the theater of the town square, learning how to swim and going to my
                        first high school football and basketball games."
